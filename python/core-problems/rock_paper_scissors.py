# Rock-Paper-Scissors

# Requirements (must all be met):
# Player vs Computer
# Player enters: rock, paper, or scissors (cAse-insensitive).
# Computer randomly picks one.
# let the player choose best of N minimum 3 (e.g., best of 5, best of 7).
# Keep score.
# After n rounds, show who won overall.
# Handle Invalid Input
# If player enters anything else â†’ Ask again without crAshing.
# Clean Code
# Follow PEP8 naming.
# Use functions to separate logic (e.g., get_winner()).
